# Case Study: A BabySit Token

In this activity, you will analyze a potential use case for tokens and how this can be generalized to other applications.

## Instructions

### Case Study Scenario

Suppose a group of parents that find it very difficult to find babysitters for their children decide to take turns watching each other's children. While this sounds like a great idea initially, it introduces a number of issues:

* How do parents reward each other for babysitting?

  * **Problem:** Paying each other in cash is not an ideal solution as disparities could arise between parents with different income levels. Parents with higher incomes might primarily use babysitting services, while parents with lower incomes might end up providing the services most of the time. It would be more valuable if all the parents would all reciprocate the babysitting activities equally.

* How can the parents ensure that everyone contributes an equal amount of babysitting hours?

  * **Problem:** Parents could keep track of each other's babysitting hours, but this could become difficult, resulting in accounting mismatches (someone might claim to have spent more hours babysitting than they actually have). Also, if one family spent all of their time babysitting for another family, no one else would by aware of this, and verification could become challenging.

### Case Study Question

How could a **BabySit Token** solve the problems detailed above?

Try to identify the core elements of the issues that tokens are very well suited for resolving.
